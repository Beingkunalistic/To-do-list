# To-do-list
I have made this to-do-list app using JavaScript. The UI was made using HTMl and CSS. I have also added the functionality of switching between light mode and dark mode. This function is still a work in progress and I am working on making the script efficient and work well with the UI. Maybe a few changes in the logic.
